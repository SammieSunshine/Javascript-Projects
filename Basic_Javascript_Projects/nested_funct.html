        <p> Nested functions are contained functions within a function</p>
            <ol>Can be a program within a program (sub-program)</ol>
            <ol>Parameters are explained within the larger, enveloping entity</ol>

        <h2>Example of a nested function </h2>
        
        <button id="counting" onclick="count_function()">click here</button>
        <p> If you were to view the JS code, it looks a bit like "function-ception". In the code, though, the "plus_one()" function would be the nested function.
